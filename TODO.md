# TODO

- Implement M extension for multiplication and division
- Re-do Nix integration to make cross-compiling test programs less
  annoying
- Revisit linker scripts and compiler flags to see if we can get
  libgcc to link correctly (or switch to clang and do the same for
  compiler-rt).
- Implement Zicsr instructions.
- Implement very basic supervisor mode, with virtual memory(Sv32) etc.
